    "This file contains the target function for a leaf proces in <b>ExampleMultiprocessingMerge</b>. The leaf process represents a process that gets data from a sensor or some other external source. In this code the external source is a random number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The leaf process does not use IoTPy other than to import <b>ExternalStream</b>. (If you prefer, you can implement the simple code that implements <b>ExternalStream</b>  --- see <b>Stream.py</b> --- rather than import it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The process appends random numbers to the external stream, <b>stream_to_root</b>. The process also prints the random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process does not <b><i>read</i></b> external streams (though it writes them). Also, this process does not use <b>streams<b> (though it uses ExternalStream). So, we don't have to specify the input queue for the process, and we don't have to start the scheduler for this process; however, it's fine if you do.\n",

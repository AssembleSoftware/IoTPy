    "# Example Multiprocessing Simple\n",
    "\n",
    "This example consists of three files of a simple example of multiprocessing. The files are:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        example_multiprocessing_simple\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        example_multiprocessing_simple_process_x\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        example_multiprocessing_simple_process_y\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "The last two files contain the target functions for processes x and y, respectively.\n",
    "The target functions are put in separate files because of a feature of iPython and\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Processes and Streams in the Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The example consists of two processes: <b>process_x</b> and <b>process_y</b>, which\n",
    "have input streams called 'x' and 'y', respectively.\n",
    "When <b>process_x</b> gets a new item on the stream named 'x' the process prints the\n",
    "item and appends the item, incremented by 1, to the stream named 'y'.\n",
    "Likewise, when <b>process_y</b> gets a new item on the stream named 'y' the process prints the\n",
    "item and appends the item, incremented by 1, to the stream named 'x'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>process_y</b> starts by sending 1 on the stream called 'x'. So, <b>process_x</b> prints 1,\n",
    "then <b>process_y</b> prints 2, then <b>process_x</b> prints 3, and so forth. The order of\n",
    "printing is an arbitrary interleaving of these values because it depends on which process\n",
    "gets the printer first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>process_y</b> keeps track of the number of messages that it sends and halts execution after\n",
    "sending 3 messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>\n",

    "        <b>q_x, q_y</b> are the input\n",
    "        queues for processes x and y. Putting <b>q_x, q_y</b> into a dict helps to ensure that\n",
    "        that both processes get identical values for <b>q_x, q_y</b>.\n",

    "## Serializing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This code uses <i>JSON</i> for serializing data. You can also use <i>pickle</i> as illustrated\n",
    "in <b>example_multiprocessing_simple_pickle.py</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain types of Python objects cannot be serialized using <i>JSON</i>. So, use <i>pickle</i>\n",
    "when you want to pass complex types of classes or complex numbers between processes.\n",
    "The IoTPy library uses <i>JSON</i> as the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use <i>JSON</i> for distributed (message-passing) computing.\n",
    "<i>pickle</i> cannot be used with some message-passing libraries.\n"

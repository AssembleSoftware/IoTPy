Sensors, social media, news feeds, webcams and other sources of data generate streams of data. Many applications ingest and analyze data streams to control actuators, generate alerts, and feed continuous displays. This package helps in building such data-streaming applications.

"Event Processing: Designing IT Systems for Agile Companies" by Chandy and Schulte describes several applications that detect and respond to events by analyzing streams of data. The central idea in complex event processing (CEP) is that data streams are sequences of events, and the goal of processing is to produce streams of more useful, actionable events. The software described here shows how to build CEP applications.

Powerful software libraries exist in a variety of domains including data analytics, artificial intelligence, signal processing and science. Programs in these libraries apply a function to input data to obtain output and then terminate. By contrast, streaming applications are perpetual processes that analyze endless data streams without terminating. This package has a library of methods for encapsulating non-streaming programs to get applications that operate on endless streams. 

Data streams are processed in networks, with data originating in sensors or other sources. In some applications a part of the processing is executed in the cloud. Several packages are available for stream processing in the cloud. The software described in these notes is for processing at the "edges" of networks, near sensors, as well as for processing in servers. The software helps in creating data-streaming applications with multiple threads and processes that run on networks of multicore computers.

In summary, this package helps the development of data streaming applications in two ways:

 Encapsulate the wealth of software that operates on non-streaming data structures to obtain software that operates on endless data streams.
Build parallel applications by connecting streams that are output by components to streams that are input by other components.
The package is being developed by groups of students and staff, many of whom are, or were, at Caltech (the California Institute of Technology). Others are welcome to participate. The package is designed to help to introduce event processing and distributed computing to undergraduates.

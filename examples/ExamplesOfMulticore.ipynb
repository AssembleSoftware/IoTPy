Process p0 has a single input stream <i>x</i> and a single output stream <i>y</i>. Process p1 has a single input stream <i>y</i> and no output streams. Thus, the output <i>y</i> of process p0 is the input of process p1.\n",

    "## Example of a grid computation\n",
    "Grid computations are used in science, for example in computing the temperature of a metal plate. The grid is partitioned into regions with a process assigned to simulate each region. On the n-th step, each process reads the values of relevant parts of the grid and updates its own value.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This example uses two copies of the grid; the two copies are <b>even</b> and <b>odd</b>. On even steps (i.e., steps 0, 2, 4,..) each process reads the <i>even</i> grid and updates its portion of the <i>odd</i> grid. So, each portion of the grid is modified by only one process. And no process is reading values while the values are being modified.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "By symmetry, on odd steps, each process reads the <i>odd</i> grid and updates its portion of the <i>even</i> grid.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "### The example problem\n",
    "A linear metal bar of length <i>N</i> is partitioned into a grid of <i>N</i> continuous regions. Grid 0 is kept at a constant temperature of 0 degrees while grid <i>N-1</i> is kept at a constant temperature of <i>N-1</i> degrees. Initially, the temperature at intermediate grid points is arbitrary; in the code below, the temperature at grid point <i>i</i> exceeds <i>i</i> by <i>DELTA</i>.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Let <b>TEMP[i][k]</b> be the temperature of the <i>i</i>-th region on step <i>k</i>. Then:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>TEMP[0][k] = 0 </li>\n",
    "    <li>TEMP[N-1][k] = N-1 </li>\n",
    "    <li>TEMP[i][k] = (TEMP[i-1][k] + TEMP[i][k] + TEMP[i+1][k])/3 i in [1, ..,N-2] </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processes\n",
    "The computation uses <i>N-2</i> processes. The <i>i</i>-th process is called 'grid_i' and is responsible for simulating the <i>i</i>-th region.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Each process takes the <i>k + 1</i>-th step after it has finished the <i>k</i>-th step and it has determined that its neighbors have also finished the <i>k</i>-th step.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streams\n",
    "The system has one stream, <b>s_i</b> for the <i>i</i>-th process. This stream contains the elements [0, 1, .. , k] after the <i>i</i>-th process has completed <i>k</i>-th steps.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Process <i>grid_i</i> outputs stream <i>s_i</i> and inputs streams from its neighboring processes which are <i>grid_(i-1)</i> if <i>i</i> exceeds 1 and <i>grid_(i+1)</i> if <i>i</i> is less than <i>N-1</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Structure\n",
    "The process structure is linear with each process getting input streams from each of its neighbors and sending its output stream to all its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Function\n",
    "The process begins by sending 0 on its output stream to indicate that it has finished its 0-th step.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The <i>k</i>-th value of <i>in_streams[j]</i> is <i>k</i> when the <i>j</i>-th neighboring process has completed its <i>k</i>-th step.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>synch_stream</b> is an internal stream of the process. The <i>k</i>-th element of this stream is <i>k</i> after all neighboring processes have completed their <i>k</i>-th step.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The zip_map function <i>r</i> operates on a list with one element from each neighbor. All the elements of the list will be <i>k</i> on the <i>k</i>-th step. The zip_map function returns <i>k</i> which is any element of the list. In this example it returns the 0-th element.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Thus the zip_map function acts as a synchronizer. It waits until all neighbors have completed the <i>k</i>-step and then it outputs <i>k</i>.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Function <i>g</i> is called for the <i>k</i>-th time when this process and all its neighbors have completed <i>k - 1</i> steps. Function <i>g</i> does the grid computation. Function <i>r</i> and the zip_map agent are used merely for synchronizing.\n",
    "### run()\n",
    "Function <i>f</i> calls <b>run</b> after it has declared all its agents. Without calling run() the function will take no action.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Note that when using external source threads, you should not call <i>run</i> because the source threads are responsible for starting and stopping the main computational thread. This example has no source threads so you must call <i>run</i> to start the system.\n"

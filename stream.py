    -----
    1. SUBSCRIBING TO A STREAM

    When a stream is modified, all functions that are subscribers
    of the stream are put on a queue called q_callbacks.
    Each function in this queue is called in turn.

    Notes
    -----
    The functionality of mapping an infinite
    stream on bounded memory is implemented
    as follows.
    
    The elements of a stream are stored in the buffer
    self.recent which is a NumPy array or a list of
    fixed size num_in_memory. The most recent values
    of the stream are in self.recent[: self.stop].

    If appending values to self.recent causes self.stop
    to exceed num_in_memory, then the elements in
    self.recent are compacted so as to retain only the
    most recent values, and the earlier values are
    discarded. This is done by the function
    _set_up_next_recent().

    A function r does not read elements of the stream
    before index self.start[r]. So, no function reads
    elements of the stream before:
         min_start = min(self.start.values()
    So, only the elements of recent with indices
    between min_start and stop need to be retained
    in self.recent. These elements are shifted down
    by _set_up_next_recent() elements.

        A StreamArray is a version of Stream treated as a NumPy array.
        The buffer, recent, is a NumPy array.
        
        The parameters for StreamArray are the same as for Stream
        except that StreamArray has dimension and dtype (see below).

        Parameters
        ----------
        dimension: a nonnegative integer, or a non-empty tuple or a
            a non-empty list, or an array of positive integers.
        dtype: a NumPy data type

        Notes
        -----
        If dimension is 0, then:
            each element of the stream is an an element of type dtype.
            For example, if dimension is 0, and dtype is float then
            the stream is a sequence of floats.
        If dimension is a positive integer, then:
            each element of the stream is a 1-D array where the 
            length of the array is dimension. Each element of the array
            is of type, dtype.
            Think of the stream as an infinite 2-D array where the
            number of columns is dimension and the number of rows is
            unbounded.
            For example, if dimension is 10 and dtype is int32, then the
            stream is a 2-D NumPy array in which each row is:
            an array with 10 elements each of type 32-bit integer and
            the number of columns is arbitrarily large.
            An unbounded stream is stored in the buffer, self.recent, which
            is a 2-D array whose elements are of type dtype. The number of
            columns of self.recent is dimension and the number of rows is
            num_in_memory, and only the most recent num_in_memory elements
            of the stream are saved in main memory.
        If dimension is a tuple or list then:
            this tuple or list must be strictly positive integers.
            In this case, each element of the stream is an N-dimensional
            array where N is the length of the tuple.  The elements of
            the array are of type dtype. The size of the array is given by
            the tuple.
            For example, if dimension is (2, 2) and dtype is float, then
            each element of the stream is a 2 X 2 NumPy array of floats.
